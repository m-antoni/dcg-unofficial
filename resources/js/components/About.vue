						<h3 align="center" class="pt-3">How We Started</h3>
						<p>
							The DC Group was established in 2002 in the Philippines, initially, as a small trading company of electronics, apparels and overruns. By 2005, the DC Group expanded by creating a consultancy firm providing corporate affairs services, helping professionals, organizations and corporations on matters pertaining to their start-up, marketing, advertising and event needs and requirements. After continuously assisting and serving the ever growing needs and requirements of our clients, in 2009, the DC Group then decided to incorporate more value-added services such as project management, human resource assistance, printing services, legal services and accounting services, among others. Due to its continued growth, innovation and development, in 2014 the DC Group then decided to be of more help and assistance to its clients by means of establishing itself as a private investment vehicle primarily in the business of venture capital, mergers and acquisitions via internally generated private equity, assets, resources & holdings.
